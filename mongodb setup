1. Open a CLI window and type the following
cd /blah/blah/node_api<enter>
mkdir data<enter>
mongod --dbpath /blah/blah/node_api<enter>
2. A bunch of text should appear, you will see "I NETWORK [initandlisten]" alot;
3. Open a new CLI window and type: mongo<enter>
4. Hopefully you will see "MongoDB shell version: 3.0.1 connecting to: test" If not, go to the root folder of your OS and make a directory called "data" and then repeat from step 3. above
5. In the second "mongo<enter>" CLI window type: use node_api*
6. You should see "switched to db node_api"*
7. Open server.js and change the "mongoose.connect..." line to the following:
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/node_api');*
8. In a third [new?] CLI window ctrl+C (if necessary), cd to blah/blah/node_api* (if necessary) and then run "node server.js" again.

You should now have a mongo db located in node_api/data and be connecting to it via server.js

* substitute "node_api" for whatever the name of your project folder is.
